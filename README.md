# Introduction To Robotics (2021 - 2022)

Introduction to Robotics laboratory homeworks, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. We will discuss and learn about robotics using Arduino Uno. 

# Homework 1 - Light up and RGB led

## Components

* RGB led
* wires and 3 resistors
* 3 potentiometers

## Task

Use a separat potentiometer in controlling each of the color of the RGB led (Red,Green and Blue).  The control must be done with digital electronics(you must read the value of the potentiometer with Arduino, and write a mapped value to each of the pins connected to the led).
